Question 1
1. The value of 3 since it prints the length of the input array.

Question 2
2. It will print out the last discounted price, which in this case is 150.

Question 3
3. It will print out the last final price, which in this case is 150

Question 4
4. The function will return an array of the discounted prices, which is [50, 100, 150] in this case.

Question 5
5. An error occurs because i is defined for the for loop, but not for the function.

Question 6
6. An error occurs because discountedPrice is defined for the for loop, but not for the function.

Question 7
7. The function will print the final price, which is 150 in this case because finalprice is declared for the whole function.

Question 8
8. The function will return an array of the discounted prices, which is [50, 100, 150] in this case.

Question 9
9. It will cause an error because i is only defined for the for loop.

Question 10
10. It will print out 3, which is the length of the input array in this case and because length is declared for the function.

Question 11
11. The function will return the discounted array, which is [50, 100, 150] in this case.

Question 12.
A. student.name
B. student['Grad Year']
C. student.greeting()
D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
E. student.courseLoad[0]

Question 13.
A. 32, int gets type casted to string
B. Error, int gets type casted but cannot subtract from string
C. 3, null is ignored when adding ints
D. Error, null cannot be added to a string
E. 4, boolean true is 1
F. 0, boolean false is 0 and null is ignored
G. 3undefined, undefined gets typecasted to string
H. NaN, happens when undefined is subtracted from string

Question 14.
A. True, '2' gets type casted to int.
B. Error, cannot compare strings
C. Error, cannot compare strings
D. Error, cannot compare strings
E. False, boolean true is 1 and 1 != 2.
F. True, boolean of 2 turns into true and true === true.

Question 15.
=== returns false if the types differ, while == will still return true through typecasting

Question 17.
The result will be an array of [2, 4, 6]. This is because callback goes back to the doSomething function, which will multipliy the values in the array by 2 with how it has been implemented.

Question 19.
It prints:
1
4
3
2
This is because the delay in 2 and 3 causes them to be later.
